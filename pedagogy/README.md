#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u>  
To determine the wavelength of different spectral lines of mercury light using a plane transmission grating, you can follow these steps:<br>

1. Gather equipment: You will need a plane transmission grating, a mercury light source, a screen or paper for recording the spectra, and a ruler or spectrometer for measuring the wavelengths.<br>
2. Set up the grating: Place the grating in front of the mercury light source so that the light passes through the grating and illuminates the screen or paper. The grating should be positioned so that the lines on the grating are parallel to the surface of the screen or paper.<br>
3. Observe the spectra: Observe the spectra that are produced on the screen or paper. The light passing through the grating will produce a diffraction pattern of bright and dark lines, which represent the different wavelengths of light in the mercury spectrum.<br>
4. Measure the wavelengths: Use a ruler or spectrometer to measure the distance between the center of one bright line and the center of the next bright line. This distance is called the spectral line spacing and is directly proportional to the wavelength of the light.<br>
5. Determine the wavelength: Once you have measured the spectral line spacing, you can use the following formula to determine the wavelength of each spectral line:<br>

Wavelength = (d * n) / (m - 1)
    
Where:
    
d = the line spacing<br>
n = the order of the line (1 for first order, 2 for second order, etc.)<br>
m = the number of lines per millimeter of the grating.    <br>
    
6. Repeat for each spectral line: Repeat steps 4 and 5 for each spectral line in the mercury spectrum to determine the wavelength of each line.<br>
    
7. Record results: Record the wavelength of each spectral line in a table or graph for later analysis and comparison.<br>

    
###### Assessment Method: 
The following steps can be followed to determine the wavelength of different spectral lines of mercury light using plane transmission grating:<br>

1. Set up the apparatus: Mount the plane transmission grating on a stand, and position it such that the grating surface is perpendicular to the incident light. Attach a mercury lamp to the stand so that the light from the lamp passes through the grating. Place a screen or a detector such as a spectrometer at the other end of the grating to record the diffracted light.

2. Calibrate the grating: Determine the grating constant ‘d’ of the grating. This can be done by shining a monochromatic light source of known wavelength through the grating and measuring the diffracted angles. Using the equation nλ = dsinθ, the grating constant can be calculated.
    
3. Measure the diffracted light: Turn on the mercury lamp, and adjust the position of the screen or detector until the brightest lines are visible. Measure the angle of each spectral line, and use the equation nλ = dsinθ to calculate the corresponding wavelength. Repeat the process for different spectral lines, and record the wavelengths.
    
4. Analysis: Compare the measured wavelengths with known values of the spectral lines of mercury light, and calculate the percentage error if necessary.
   
Note: The accuracy of the measurements can be improved by using a more precise spectrometer, a higher-quality grating, and a more stable light source.


<u> <b>Description: </b>    </u>
<br>
A plane transmission grating is an optical component that is used to separate light into its different wavelengths or spectral lines. To determine the wavelength of different spectral lines of mercury light, the following steps can be followed: <br>
 
1. Obtain a plane transmission grating and set it up in the optical path between the light source and the detector.  <br>
    
2. Turn on the light source and shine the mercury light through the grating.<br>
    
3. Observe the resulting spectrum on the detector. The grating will split the light into its different spectral lines, which will appear as individual lines in the spectrum.<br>
    
4. Measure the position of each spectral line in the spectrum using a ruler or a micrometer.<br>
    
5. Using the grating equation, calculate the wavelength of each spectral line by comparing the position of the line with the grating constant and the angle of incidence. The grating equation is given by:<br>
    
mλ = d (sin θi - sin θr)<br>
    
where,<br>
`m` is the order of the spectral line, <br>
`λ` is the wavelength, <br>
`d` is the grating constant, <br>
`θi` is the angle of incidence, and <br>
`θr` is the angle of reflection.<br>
    
6. Repeat the above steps for multiple orders of the spectral lines to obtain a more accurate and complete measurement of the wavelengths of the different spectral lines of mercury light.<br>
   
With this method, the wavelengths of different spectral lines of mercury light can be determined with a high degree of accuracy and precision.

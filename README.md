### About the Experiment 

A plane transmission grating is a device that is used to separate light into its component wavelengths. To determine the wavelength of different spectral lines of mercury light using a plane transmission grating, you would need to follow these steps:<br><br>
1. Obtain a source of mercury light, such as a mercury-vapor lamp.
2. Place the grating in front of the light source, so that the light passes through the grating.

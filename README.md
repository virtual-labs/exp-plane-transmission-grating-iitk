### About the Experiment 

A plane transmission grating is a device that is used to separate light into its component wavelengths. To determine the wavelength of different spectral lines of mercury light using a plane transmission grating, you would need to follow these steps:

1. Obtain a source of mercury light, such as a mercury-vapor lamp.<br>

2. Place the grating in front of the light source, so that the light passes through the grating.<br>

3. Observe the light that is transmitted through the grating. You will see a spectrum of light, with different colors separated into distinct lines.<br>

4. Measure the angle between the central maximum of a spectral line and the grating's normal, using a protractor or a spectrometer.<br>

5. Use the formula for the grating equation to calculate the wavelength of the spectral line:<br><br>
                      λ = d (sin θ + mλg)

where:<br>
d = the grating constant, which is the distance between adjacent rulings on the grating<br>
θ = the angle between the central maximum and the grating's normal<br>
m = an integer that represents the order of the spectral line<br>
λg = the wavelength of the light used in the experiment<br>

By repeating this process for different spectral lines, you can determine the wavelength of each line.

It is important to note that the accuracy of this method is dependent on the quality of the grating and the precision of the measurements.<br><br>

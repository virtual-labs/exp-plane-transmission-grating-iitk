The procedure to determine the wavelength of different spectral lines of mercury light using a plane transmission grating is as follows:<br>
1. Obtain a mercury light source and a plane transmission grating.<br>
2. Place the mercury light source on one side of the grating, and set up a screen on the other side to observe the diffracted light.<br>
3. Observe the diffracted light on the screen and identify the spectral lines of mercury light.<br>
4. Measure the angle between the incident light and the diffracted light for a particular spectral line.<br>
5. Use the formula for grating equation to calculate the wavelength of the spectral line:<br><br>
          sin(Θ) = nλ / d
<br><br>
where,<br>
`Θ` is the angle between the incident light and the diffracted light, <br>
`n` is the order of diffraction, <br>
`λ` is the wavelength of the spectral line, and <br>
`d` is the grating constant (the distance between two consecutive lines on the grating).
<br>
7. Repeat the process for different spectral lines to determine the wavelengths of multiple lines.<br>
8. Compare the calculated wavelengths with the known wavelengths of mercury spectral lines to confirm the accuracy of the measurement.<br>
<br>
Note: This procedure assumes that the grating is a plane transmission grating and that the incident light is collimated.
